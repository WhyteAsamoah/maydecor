### Final Year Project: Augmented Reality: An online interior items shopping web app

<a name="top"></a>

This AR web app has the potential to revolutionize the way people shop for interior d√©cor. By allowing potential buyers to visualize objects in their home while shopping online. The one thing that this project ultimately has to accomplish well is to enable people to see how the item they intend to buy will look in their homes via the camera on their phone while hanging around at home or at work. It can help them make more informed decisions about their purchases.
